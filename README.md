## About

This repository provides a working reference for a Patchouli book. It's useful as a
starting point for your own book.

There are two parts of this repo, the mod example and the modpack example, demonstrating
using Patchouli as part of a mod, and as an externally loaded modpack book.

If you want to use the modpack part, look at `run/resourcepacks/patchouliexample`.

If you want to use the mod part, look at `src/main/resources/patchouliexample/`.
The mod part uses Fabric for simplicity, but Patchouli should behave the same way across
Fabric and Forge.

The branch name marks the version of Minecraft this example is built and tested against.

The team does not have the resources to replicate this example book for versions prior
to 1.19. Patches from the community to add examples for previous Minecraft versions are
welcomed.
